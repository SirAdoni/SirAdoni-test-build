/**
 * The published JSON Schema for ruleset authors (`docs/extending/ruleset.schema.json`) is generated
 * from the shared zod schema. This pins that the committed file is current, so an editor never
 * flags a key the Engine accepts or misses one it refuses. Needs the shared package built, which
 * `pnpm regression:node` does first.
 *
 * It also pins that every shipped example is a file the schema describes: each one imports cleanly,
 * and the published schema carries a member for each resolution kind they are written in. A schema
 * that is current but has quietly lost a kind would put a red squiggle under a correct file, which
 * is exactly the help an author would learn to ignore.
