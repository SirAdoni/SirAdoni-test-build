### ChatGPT Game Mode history-cache reuse with changing state

#### Problem and scope

The affected ChatGPT Game Mode requests could keep reusing a static lore prefix while their total input grew. A declining cached-input percentage alone is not proof of a cache failure; request inspection also identified two local blockers: replay rejected legitimate system-role runtime snapshots, and eligibility counted configured tools even when a separate tool connection owned them.

This patch changes the existing replay implementation. It does not introduce a second caching service, promise provider cache retention, or alter Claude's cache placement.

#### Changed production modules

- `packages/server/src/services/generation/prompt-history-replay.ts`: seeds a snapshot-scoping preamble in the canonical prompt before the first current-turn injection. The first archived request therefore already contains the boundary needed for later append-only replay.
- The preamble remains at system priority and identifies snapshots as applying to the following user turn. The newest snapshot replaces previous snapshots, including fields no longer present. Standing instruction priority remains unchanged.
- Replay permits system-role injections only when their internal metadata contains both the runtime marker and the explicit snapshot marker. A generic runtime marker alone is insufficient. Unknown system messages fail closed.
- These markers are internal producer contracts, not an authentication mechanism or permission for arbitrary user-authored instructions.
- Replay retains the exact previously sent expanded prompt, then appends the intervening assistant history, new scoped state and current user turn. Descriptor construction continues to use the canonical prompt, separately from the expanded provider prompt, so offsets do not drift on successive turns.
- Replay scope version increases to 2 to invalidate descriptors using the old boundary contract. Descriptor shape version remains 1. No database migration, chat rewrite or deletion is required.
- `packages/server/src/services/generation/prompt-cache-layout.ts`: adds an explicit optional snapshot opt-in to the existing runtime-message wrapper. Its default remains off; only newly inserted system messages are marked when requested.
- `packages/server/src/services/generation/game-gm-prompt-runtime.ts`: explicitly identifies producer-owned dynamic GM context as a replay snapshot.
- `packages/server/src/routes/generate.routes.ts`: opts spatial context and continuity snapshots into the contract, seeds eligible canonical messages before fitting and descriptor creation, and counts tools on the actual narrator request. When a separate Game Mode tool connection owns tools, narrator tool count is zero; otherwise the responder's tool definitions determine eligibility.
- Rationale comments document scope invalidation, producer boundaries, preamble priority, canonical-versus-expanded persistence and actual narrator tool ownership.

#### Preserved boundaries and compatibility

- Eligibility remains restricted to the existing ChatGPT merged Game Mode path for an ordinary explicit user turn. Regeneration, continuation, impersonation, autonomous turns and tool follow-up iterations remain excluded.
- Narrator requests carrying tools remain excluded. Model, scope, source-message, swipe, hash, text-only and context-budget checks remain in place.
- Existing entry criteria remain: a sufficiently large prompt (200,000 characters), reported cached input greater than zero, and a cached-input fraction below 80 percent. An established valid replay chain may continue above that fraction. These are local replay heuristics, not provider cache specifications.
- Added historical-state overhead remains bounded by the smaller of 500,000 characters and 50 percent of canonical prompt characters. Requests that cannot satisfy existing guards fall back to canonical construction.
- No new provider API parameters, dependencies, persisted schema fields or Claude-specific changes are introduced.

#### Regression coverage

- `scripts/regressions/prompt-history-replay.regression.ts`: existing replay guards and the revised seeded-boundary contract.
- `scripts/regressions/prompt-history-replay-route.regression.ts`: actual route eligibility expression, including separate tool ownership and narrator tools.
- `scripts/regressions/prompt-history-replay-snapshots.regression.ts`: producer-owned snapshots, first-turn seeding, marker rejection and compatibility boundaries.
- `scripts/regressions/prompt-history-replay-wire.regression.ts`: the actual OpenAI message mapper across successive turns, exact previous-prefix preservation and mixed user/system state with a removed roster entry.
- Fixtures are synthetic. Tests do not contain saved campaign content, credentials or private installation paths.

#### Verification and limitations

- Frozen-lockfile installation and full `pnpm check` passed in the destination checkout, including formatting, lint/type checks and production builds.
- All four targeted replay regression files passed in the destination checkout.
- All 16 cache-filtered regression files passed, along with context-fit, prompt-attachments and the broad prompt regression: 23 regression files passed in total including the four targeted replay files. The broad prompt regression passed in this fork checkout; a separate earlier source-checkout failure is not attributed to this destination build.
- Deterministic tests establish request construction and guard behavior. They do not establish an improved live provider cache-hit rate or guarantee model adherence to snapshot instructions. The first eligible request establishes the revised boundary; subsequent compatible turns can reuse it. Provider eviction, expiry and changing canonical context can still reduce reuse.

#### Operational privacy

The local installation transfer is separate from this source contribution. Active data was copied and hash-verified with the source stopped; originals were retained. Backup archives, old diagnostics/logs and disposable caches were excluded. Generated dependency junctions were recreated against the destination. Private data, connection secrets, encryption keys, environment files and migration manifests are not part of the commit.

### Follow-up: align replay eligibility with ChatGPT transport tool omission

- Live post-deployment requests still reported the same cached-input count as input grew. Their saved replay descriptors were null and their prompts lacked the seeded preamble. The previous change had not activated replay for this incident; deterministic validation did not establish a live cache improvement.
- Both affected saved prompt arrays passed offline snapshot seeding and descriptor creation. Replaying the second against the first preserved the complete previous prompt prefix under the configured context budget. Private request contents remained local and were not added to fixtures or source control.
- The remaining mismatch is between configured responder tools and serialized provider requests: the ChatGPT Responses builder deliberately omits native tool schemas, while the route counted those definitions as a replay exclusion. The separate Game Mode tool-connection correction did not cover that transport behavior.
- The generation route now evaluates the ChatGPT transport's effective native tool count. This is narrowly scoped to its existing tool-omission contract; it does not change tool execution, enable native ChatGPT tools, alter Claude handling or expand replay to other providers.
- Existing final-prompt hash checks still prevent persisting a descriptor if later tool execution or other processing changes the actual request. Existing source/swipe, scope, snapshot trust and budget guards remain authoritative.
- Debug-mode diagnostics report eligibility booleans/counts, snapshot seeding, descriptor creation, source guard/threshold decisions and final persistence. They contain no prompt text, character names or credential values.
- Regression coverage exercises the actual Responses request builder with configured tools, alongside the production route's tool-count expression, so provider omission and route eligibility cannot silently diverge again.
- Verification: full `pnpm check` passed, including formatting, lint/type checks and production builds. All 23 replay, cache, attachment, context-fit and broad prompt regression files passed. The real Responses request-builder fixture confirms that configured tools are absent from ChatGPT requests and present on ordinary OpenAI requests. Actual provider cache-hit improvement remains unverified until the rebuilt server handles successive eligible turns.
