// What a ruleset fight's log says, in the ruleset's own words and the server's own numbers.
//
// One module, because the log, the recap and the refusal toasts must never spell the same fight two
// ways. Everything here is pure: it takes the definition the game pinned, the view the server sent
// and a translator, and gives back strings. No arithmetic of its own is done anywhere in it. Every
// number printed was computed by the resolver and carried in the event, which is the whole point of
// the events carrying their rolls: a screen that recomputed a total could disagree with the fight.
//
// Nothing here is shaped around one game system. Budget names, condition names, save names, track
// names and tier names all come out of the definition, so a fight on Ember Roads reads in Ember
// Roads' words and a fight on 5e reads in 5e's.
