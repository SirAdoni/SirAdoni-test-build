/**
 * The Decision model setting: which model answers agent activation questions.
 *
 * One choice for the whole engine, offered as one list. Connections are stored rows
 * and keep using the ordinary `defaultForAgents` flag; local slots have no row, so the
 * chosen one is recorded as an app setting. Selecting either side clears the other, so
 * the list and the stored state can never disagree.
 *
 * Entries that cannot serve right now are returned with a reason rather than omitted:
 * hiding the local model entry produces "where did it go" reports from users who were
 * told the feature exists.
