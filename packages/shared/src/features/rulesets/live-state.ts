// Live state of a ruleset character sheet: the part of a sheet that changes during play, on top of
// the static build the sheet editor writes.
//
// It is stored SPARSE and read TOLERANTLY. Only a value somebody changed is stored; everything else
// reads as its declared default, so a pool that starts full follows its maximum when a level-up
// raises it, and junk in the stored blob costs that one entry rather than the whole sheet. Writes
// normalise the other way: a value back at its default drops out of the store again, so it starts
// following the maximum once more.
//
// Nothing here is system-specific. Every pool, track, text field, condition and rest comes from the
// definition, so a 2d6 game whose only pool is an empty-start "stress" track works exactly as well
// as a d20 game with spell slots.

//   partway through is handled by the same rule as one that was already full.

//   would upgrade past the highest severity is kept at the highest, and the one that could not land
